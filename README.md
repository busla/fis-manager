Member management system for the Icelandic Taekwondo Association (TKI)

The main purpose of this application is to administrate clubs, members, tournaments and competitor results. Members can be imported from a FELIX csv file.

Tournament registration and management is currently being handled by a set of programmed Excel documents that is able to export a csv with all matches and related data (competitor, points, match number, et.c.) that we are parsing and adding to existing members.

An API is also being actively developed and first steps have been taking in iOS/Android app development.
